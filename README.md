## Trieve Hackernews Search

To showcase the functionality of Trieve, we are building a demo of HackerNews search which has feature superiority relative to the Algolia version. 

## Local Dev Setup

1. `cp .env.dist .env` to setup environment variables. For this demo, the user should only need the read-only API key present in the default `.env.dist` file. 
2. `yarn` to install dependencies
3. `yarn dev` to start the SolidJS SPA

## Contributing

Most of the functionality is present directly in the `src/App.tsx` file. 

Read that file to see how things work and then go from there to develop your feature.
